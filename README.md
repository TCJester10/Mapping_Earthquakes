# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using Javascript and APIs to map out Earthquakes that took place over the last seven days. Leafly was the main mapping information source, while all earthquake data was 
taken from the USGS website. 
These maps are neat, three layers (standard, satelitte, and night) and the data for all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes 
(done in blue to distinguish the layer) are visible on all three maps. 

Here are a couple of examples centered over the Americas
